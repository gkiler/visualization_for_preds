# SMILES Annotation System Analysis & Architectural Plan

## Current System Analysis

### How Annotations Are Currently Handled

#### 1. **AnnotationProcessor** (`src/data/annotation_processor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Processes SMILES annotations and updates network accordingly
- **Key Methods**:
  - `process_pending_annotations()`: Processes all pending SMILES annotations
  - `_process_single_annotation()`: Applies SMILES to node's `library_SMILES` property
  - `apply_all_pending_updates()`: Applies all pending updates and marks nodes as blue
  - `_mark_annotated_nodes()`: Sets blue color (`#2196F3`) for annotated nodes

#### 2. **AnnotationManager** (`src/utils/annotation_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages annotation persistence and state tracking
- **Key Methods**:
  - `add_annotation()`: Adds annotation to session state
  - `apply_annotations_to_network()`: Updates node properties with annotated SMILES
  - `save_annotations_to_file()`: Persists annotations to `annotations/smiles_annotations.json`
  - `get_effective_smiles()`: Returns annotated SMILES (takes precedence over original)

#### 3. **ChemicalNode** (`src/data/models.py`)
- **Annotation Methods**:
  - `is_annotated()`: Checks if `annotation_status == 'user_annotated'`
  - `get_effective_smiles()`: Returns `library_SMILES` property
  - `apply_annotation_to_node()`: Updates node's `library_SMILES` and annotation status

### How GraphML Files Are Loaded and Processed

#### **DataLoader** (`src/data/loader.py`)
- **GraphML Loading**: `load_network_from_graphml()`
  - Uses NetworkX to read GraphML files
  - Processes graph links and assigns USI values
  - Converts node/edge data to ChemicalNetwork objects
  - Handles property type conversion (strings to numbers)
  - Removes unwanted edge columns
  - Processes mass decomposition

### Current Data Flow Issues

1. **Session State vs File Persistence**: Annotations stored in both session state and file
2. **Multiple SMILES Properties**: Nodes can have original GraphML SMILES and annotated SMILES
3. **No GraphML File Updates**: User annotations are not written back to source GraphML files
4. **Temporary Nature**: Annotations are lost when GraphML is reloaded unless manually persisted

## Architectural Requirements for SMILES Annotation Feature

Based on your requirements:
1. Take user's SMILES input and apply it to node's `library_SMILES` property ✅ (Already working)
2. Reprocess the GraphML file with that addition ❌ (Missing)
3. Ensure we don't overwrite user changes during reprocessing ❌ (Missing)

## Proposed Architecture Solution

### 1. **Enhanced GraphML Persistence Layer**

Create a new component: **GraphMLAnnotationPersister**

```python
class GraphMLAnnotationPersister:
    """
    Handles reading and writing user annotations back to GraphML files
    while preserving original data integrity.
    """
    
    def save_annotations_to_graphml(self, network: ChemicalNetwork, 
                                  original_file_path: str, 
                                  backup: bool = True) -> bool:
        """Save user annotations back to the original GraphML file"""
        
    def create_annotated_graphml_copy(self, network: ChemicalNetwork, 
                                    original_file_path: str, 
                                    output_path: str) -> bool:
        """Create a new GraphML file with annotations applied"""
        
    def merge_annotations_with_graphml(self, graphml_path: str, 
                                     annotations: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Merge stored annotations into a GraphML file"""
```

### 2. **Change Tracking System**

Enhance the **AnnotationManager** with change tracking:

```python
class AnnotationManager:
    # Add new methods:
    
    def track_node_changes(self, node_id: str, property: str, 
                          old_value: Any, new_value: Any):
        """Track individual property changes for conflict resolution"""
        
    def get_change_history(self, node_id: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get complete change history for a node"""
        
    def detect_conflicts(self, network: ChemicalNetwork, 
                        source_file_path: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Detect conflicts between user annotations and source file changes"""
```

### 3. **File Update Strategy**

Implement a hybrid approach:

#### **Option A: In-Place Updates (Recommended)**
- Backup original GraphML file before modifications
- Update the original file with user annotations
- Maintain change log for rollback capability
- Use file locking to prevent concurrent modifications

#### **Option B: Parallel File System**
- Keep original GraphML untouched
- Create `.annotated.graphml` files with user changes
- Load logic checks for annotated version first
- Merge conflicts when original file is updated

### 4. **Integration Points with Existing Systems**

#### **Enhanced DataLoader**
```python
class DataLoader:
    @staticmethod
    def load_network_from_graphml_with_annotations(
        file_path: str, 
        annotation_manager: AnnotationManager = None
    ) -> ChemicalNetwork:
        """
        Load GraphML and automatically apply stored annotations
        """
        # 1. Load base network from GraphML
        # 2. Check for stored annotations
        # 3. Apply annotations to network
        # 4. Mark nodes as annotated (blue)
        # 5. Return merged network
```

#### **Enhanced AnnotationProcessor**
```python
class AnnotationProcessor:
    def save_annotations_to_source_file(self, network: ChemicalNetwork) -> bool:
        """
        Save all user annotations back to the original GraphML file
        """
        # 1. Identify source file path
        # 2. Create backup
        # 3. Update GraphML with annotations
        # 4. Validate updated file
        # 5. Update metadata
```

### 5. **Change Preservation Mechanisms**

#### **Conflict Resolution Strategy**
1. **User Annotations Take Precedence**: User SMILES annotations always override file values
2. **Change Detection**: Track when source files are modified
3. **Merge Conflicts**: Present UI for resolving conflicts when both user and file changed
4. **Backup System**: Automatic backups before any file modifications

#### **Data Integrity Safeguards**
```python
class DataIntegrityManager:
    def validate_graphml_structure(self, file_path: str) -> bool:
        """Ensure GraphML file structure remains valid after updates"""
        
    def create_backup(self, file_path: str) -> str:
        """Create timestamped backup before modifications"""
        
    def rollback_changes(self, file_path: str, backup_path: str) -> bool:
        """Rollback to previous version if issues occur"""
```

## Success Criteria

1. **User annotations persist across GraphML reloads**
2. **Original GraphML files can be updated with user annotations**
3. **Data integrity maintained throughout the process**
4. **Conflicts between user changes and file updates are handled gracefully**
5. **System performance remains acceptable for files up to 10k nodes**
6. **Automatic backup and rollback system works reliably**

This architecture provides a robust, maintainable solution that preserves user data integrity while enabling seamless integration between user annotations and the underlying GraphML file system.
